                I just finished setting up the virutal journal homepage i haven't linked it to the website yet, but i'll be sure to do that soon.
                I'm going to be adding more content to the virtual journal folder so it can have pages to my movie, game, and music reviews.
                I think maybe I'll start posting weekly Movie, Game, and Music reviews. I'll obviously have SO MUCH content to fill out since 
                I've been watching, playing, and listening for years. The only challenging part is going to come up with the words to let other 
                people to know whether they are missin out or to stay away. I like everything though, so most of the time it's probably going to 
                be "Why haven't you watched, played, or listened to this yet?1?!1?!"

                It would be very neat if i someday made all this dyanmic so i can just log in from my phone and just write something. Kind of like 
                a tweet, but not really since this whole site is mine. I would have to set up my own server or set a cloud one on amazon. I'm kind 
                of scared setting one up on a cloud service since i don't want to be charged for any fees exceeding my bank account. I also don't 
                like knowing that my site could be hacked. I have to look into that stuff becuase I really don't know how to protect myself online.
                If I ever do make the site like that, I'll feel like a demiurge of my online life(<i>I think i'm using that word right</i>)

                I'm procrastinating yet again, and I don't have a good reason for it. I should be working more on my other assignments, but i
                just can't i'm unable to because i don't know how to start. I also don't want to be doing it and then find out i'm doing it wrong
                and then find out that i need to do it all over again or something. This sucks. I promise i'll start working on an assignment that 
                is due today, and also finish it today. If i have to go do something else, then i'll just have to work on something else the next day.
                I could probably get a lot done, but i don't know how to do it without feeling so overwhelmed. If i try setting myself some limits 
                (<i>like a schedule</i>) I'll find myself unable to follow it because of how much little time i have. 
                I slept really late yesterday because i would've rather had fun playing than sleeping to wake up early. I mean i woke up early anyway,
                but I really should've gone to sleep (<i>if i had the emoji where they show all their teeth like a yikes, i would have it here. just
                    imagine it</i>).
                I'll start getting ready to go to my 2:00pm class since it's already 1:43. I'll keep writing about today soon. I'm also decided
                I'm going to be posting the new link on here
