            <h2>Building the journal</h2>
                <h3>April 10th 1:19pm</h3>
                <p>
                    I just finished setting up the virutal journal homepage i haven't linked it to the website yet, but i'll be sure to do that soon.
                    I'm going to be adding more content to the virtual journal folder so it can have pages to my movie, game, and music reviews.
                    I think maybe I'll start posting weekly Movie, Game, and Music reviews. I'll obviously have SO MUCH content to fill out since 
                    I've been watching, playing, and listening for years. The only challenging part is going to come up with the words to let other 
                    people to know whether they are missin out or to stay away. I like everything though, so most of the time it's probably going to 
                    be "Why haven't you watched, played, or listened to this yet?1?!1?!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be very neat if i someday made all this dyanmic so i can just log in from my phone and just write something. Kind of like 
                    a tweet, but not really since this whole site is mine. I would have to set up my own server or set a cloud one on amazon. I'm kind 
                    of scared setting one up on a cloud service since i don't want to be charged for any fees exceeding my bank account. I also don't 
                    like knowing that my site could be hacked. I have to look into that stuff becuase I really don't know how to protect myself online.
                    If I ever do make the site like that, I'll feel like a demiurge of my online life(<i>I think i'm using that word right</i>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm procrastinating yet again, and I don't have a good reason for it. I should be working more on my other assignments, but i
                    just can't i'm unable to because i don't know how to start. I also don't want to be doing it and then find out i'm doing it wrong
                    and then find out that i need to do it all over again or something. This sucks. I promise i'll start working on an assignment that 
                    is due today, and also finish it today. If i have to go do something else, then i'll just have to work on something else the next day.
                    I could probably get a lot done, but i don't know how to do it without feeling so overwhelmed. If i try setting myself some limits 
                    (<i>like a schedule</i>) I'll find myself unable to follow it because of how much little time i have. 
                    I slept really late yesterday because i would've rather had fun playing than sleeping to wake up early. I mean i woke up early anyway,
                    but I really should've gone to sleep (<i>if i had the emoji where they show all their teeth like a yikes, i would have it here. just
                        imagine it</i>).
                    I'll start getting ready to go to my 2:00pm class since it's already 1:43. I'll keep writing about today soon. I'm also decided
                    I'm going to be posting the new link on here
                </p>

            <h2>Second day streak</h2>
                <h3>April 11 11:47am</h3>

                <p>
                    I'm currently working on doing something kool for this section of the site. It's just a lot of links and pointing to things. 
                    I'm going to be adding short summaries of what i did and they're going to be stored in the libarry of babel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's 12:40pm right now and I hardly made any progress on that lol. I really wish I was making this site on a server rather 
                    than on github pages. I'd very much prefer to start using PHP to do all my work for me. I don't think it would be too hard to
                    start doing that top. I have some ideas on how this stuff could work. Automating things is so much better than having to do things
                    manually. I also decided that i was not going to echo entire html pages if they didn't need to be. It's just not fair to do it. 
                    Like it's actaully annoying not being able to see color on my screen when editing on a site. I'll just gladly close and reclose php. 
                    If doing that slows down the site though, I'll just make a script that converts each line into an echo and un echos it too if i need
                    to make a change. It's so kool that i have the option to do stuff like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yesterday i felt awful and turned in that homework finally. After that i attended class online becuase i don't trust that the professor
                    is fine from covid. I was literally falling asleep during that class, but was wide awake towards the end. After that too, we got home
                    to eat Lasagna and just stayed home until the Air Jordan movie was on. The movie was at 9. I felt awful again because i stayed up way 
                    later than yesterday. I'm not going to let it happen again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll write more later because i really need to go to the restroom
                    Wow, I really needed to go. It's going to be 1, and i think i'm more glad at the fact that i was working something rather than just 
                    being on my phone. I think tomorrow I'm going to start setting up a database of all our receipts. That should get us in track. I also
                    need to start working on the assignment that is due on the 14th. I could just ask for more time, since i really am stressed, but it's 
                    going to have to be tomorrow when i ask because i seriously cannot keep up with anyhing else. i can't believe that it's not even a lot
                    of things that I have to get done. I cannot wait to turn this site into like an actual blog thing where i can post what i want. it's 
                    going to be so kool.
                </p>
                <p>I'll maybe come back to this tonight or later on in the day....or maybe during class too. I should make all this text stuff collapsable</p>
                <p>1:12pm OHH, I'M GOING TO WRITE THE REVIEW FOR MOVIE THAT I SAW YESTERDAY</p>
        <hr>
            <h2>Did not make one yesterday</h2>
                <h3>April 13 11:00am</h3>

                <p>
                    I knew that i was supposed to write a log yesterday (I even thought about it), but for some reason, it just slipped off my mind.
                    I'm going to be producing today's log in 30 minute intervals. I'm stressing out so much about this dumb midterm. I know that once i finish it
                    I am going to feel great regardless of how I do or what i end up getting. Though i really hope that i do very well on it. 
                    This professor seems very unfair with the way that the grading is going to go on the midterm. 
                    5 minutes have passed, so now i'm going back to studying for 30 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's 10:20 right now
                    I lied. I didn't end up doing it because it was too hard and I hate that class. I did end up finishing it though which I know feel great knowing
                    that I already took the exam regardless whether i passed or not. The exam wasn't all that bad since I was able to review from the test prep
                    that i created. i almost comepletely forgot about doing this, but i'm thankful that I didn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I promise myself to make the review tomorrow (maybe at night) since i liked that movie and i really liked the mario movie. 
                    I'm going to also follow those tutorials from that devsalife guy. It looks really nice to see someone actually just use a terminal to just type.
                    I'm just now figuring out how to navigate with the hjkl keys, and searching with / , and using captial I and A and lowercase a to insert stuff.
                    I hope i get better with this because i was using vim to help me with my notes. It's so much better.
                </p>

            <h2>"It's raining"</h2>
                <h3>April 14, 10:42am</h3>
                <p>
                    It's not raining, it was drizziling, but not anymore. I just wanted to make a reference to the social network lol.
                    I'm still trying to get used to using the vi/vim editor. I still don't know the difference between vi and vim.
                    Okay I just saw what Vim was and oh my goodness, i think I'd rather use that than vi. There's more features like error checking, and uh syntax highlighting....
                    I didn't really look into it that much; just looked over a diagram and assumed that was true. It would maybe be better for me to learn vi instead, so i can 
                    for sure know that it's always going to be on all computers and stuff. I was going to try and change the j and k keys because i keep confusing myself, but i 
                    saw a post on stack overflow saying that it was just better I learn it that way since a bunch of other systems rely on that same setup. The reason for j 
                    being down and k being up has something to do with how a computer's keyboard was designed, the ADM-3A. It was just slightly changed, but honestly this sucks.
                    It's just very silly that they chose the ugliest way possible to map the keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not sure if i should start labeling when i started a new paragraph tag. becuase it has been some time already and i think i would like this to be like
                    some sort of thread of the day. I think I'm going to do that. For the next paragraph tag that I make. An idea to making this blog sight thing is to continue
                    on a post from the day it was made. You wouldn't be editing the thread, you would be appending to it. There should be an append button and an edit button. An
                    edit button should be on each paragraph tag and an append button should be at the start of the thread. I wonder how all those features like underlining, bolding
                    italicizing, making tables, changing fonts, looks like. I'm sure it's all javascript, but i'm not sure. 
                </p>
                <h4>11:09am</h4>
                <p>
                    It's going pretty great so far. I don't think the assignment that i'm going to be working on is going to be too hard. I'm going to work on it after i finish this 
                    paragraph. I'm going to stage it and that would be all for my log for today. I don't want to try to write something that isn't there. Uh oh, i forgot when i was
                    supposed to work on that review. okay, i just checked it and it has to be tonight. that sux. maybe i'll write the review while i'm doing something else. I realized
                    that my future self will look back on these logs and think, "Why didn't you talk about something personal that i can look back on. I don't care about your future
                    project nor your rants." Yikes. Today was a cousin's game i couldn't go to so maybe that's something you can remember :/ . It's the championship for him and i hope
                    he wins. okay bye.

            <h2>Inconsistency</h2>
                <h3>April 19,  10:59am</h3>
                <p>
                    It's a special someone's birthday today. Not going to say who, but they're finally as old as me now (which i'm also not going to say either).
                    Today i woke up feeling a little blegh because of the pasta that i had yesteday. I shouldn't have eaten so much, but i love to eat italian food. 
                    I'm not going to pretend like I completely ignored the last 5 days. I didn't mean to ignore it, but i just couldn't get to doing them. I was doing my work,
                    tried studying more, played more. I should really start doing something else instead of being on my phone. According to my screen time for today,
                    I have just spent about 3 hours on three apps. Those three apps are Tiktok, Youtube, and Twitter. I seriously lost 3 hours of my life "catching up" on things that i haven't seen online.
                    The apple weather app keeps saying that it's going to rain, but i don't believe it. It's such a liar because it literally hasn't even drizzled a bit. 
                   I notice I start almost every sentence on here with I, I'll or I'm. I need to stop doing that because it's not really fun to read something with me me me all the time. 
                   When the time comes, it'll become less of a habit if I start to write more this way. It sounds less perfunctory when writing bout my thoughts or what happened in my day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now it's 11:12am, and choosing what to do next is next on my tasks for today. The full list of what i want to get done today is:
                    <ol>
                        <li>This commit to the jorunal</li>
                        <li>3 hours for an assignment</li>
                        <li>An quiz</li>
                        <li>Some job work</li>
                        <li>Doing some chores</li>
                        <li>A minimum of 2 hours of playing</li>
                        <li>Sleeping early</li>
                    </oL>
                    Hopefully I'll be able to complete these tasks for today. They are going to be on my reminder app, so i can see them. As for a list of things that I do not want
                    to do, I'm going to be including them in the following list:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do not watch anymore YouTube</li>
                        <li>Do not go on Twitter, Instagram, or Tiktok today</li>
                        <li>Do not buy any snacks</li>
                        <li>Do not get stuck on anything (come back to it later)</li>
                    </ol>
                    YouTube is on a separate list because I'm able to access it through my computer and get distracted.
                    There are two lists to keep track of and I'm hoping that I can follow through with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might be possible to write something down in the form of a shortuct that just appends to this file and then I can commit when i get on my computer or get home. 
                    Maybe once I get home, i'll try it out or at least think about it. I like to think about things that i could do. I just wish i had the time, skill, and effort to 
                    actually breathe them to life. I should just delete those apps if they are causing me a lot of trouble. The only way that i'll be able to access anything then would be if I just access the web version of it. I'm going to delete Twitter and Tiktok because I seriously can't stop being on them all the time. I check them like if it's some kind of drug. When there isn't anything else to see on Twitter, I still keep trying to access it.
                    Instead of deleting them, i'll limit the time for both of them to be 30 minutes long. That should be enough.
                </p>
                <p>Until next time I guess (since i never even come back to this the second time in a day).</p>

                <h3>April 20,  9:51am</h3>
                <p>
                    I got this app called "one-sec" and it does what i've been trying to do through shortcuts. I've been working on the shortcut for a long while, but i just can't get to working on it with my phone. 
                    It's annoying to be placing stuff variables and scrolling up and down just to get somewhere.
                    I feel like I won't graduate on a technicality or something. I also do not know what I am going to be doing once i graduate. I'm a hard worker and someone who actually cares about the work they do.
                    I can't just do the bare minimum becuase i actually care about the things i'm doing.
                    If it has something to do with web development or just coding, then I would be happy to do it. 
                    This log is going to be short because i felt a bit sick in the morning (probably because of how much i ate at L.A Crawfish) and because i have to be nonstop working on my assignment. 
                    My airpods are charging right now in one of those charging stations. I really hope that no one stole them or something else worse.
