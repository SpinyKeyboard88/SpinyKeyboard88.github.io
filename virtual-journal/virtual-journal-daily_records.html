            <h2>Building the journal</h2>
                <h3>April 10th 1:19pm</h3>
                <p>
                    I just finished setting up the virutal journal homepage i haven't linked it to the website yet, but i'll be sure to do that soon.
                    I'm going to be adding more content to the virtual journal folder so it can have pages to my movie, game, and music reviews.
                    I think maybe I'll start posting weekly Movie, Game, and Music reviews. I'll obviously have SO MUCH content to fill out since 
                    I've been watching, playing, and listening for years. The only challenging part is going to come up with the words to let other 
                    people to know whether they are missin out or to stay away. I like everything though, so most of the time it's probably going to 
                    be "Why haven't you watched, played, or listened to this yet?1?!1?!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be very neat if i someday made all this dyanmic so i can just log in from my phone and just write something. Kind of like 
                    a tweet, but not really since this whole site is mine. I would have to set up my own server or set a cloud one on amazon. I'm kind 
                    of scared setting one up on a cloud service since i don't want to be charged for any fees exceeding my bank account. I also don't 
                    like knowing that my site could be hacked. I have to look into that stuff becuase I really don't know how to protect myself online.
                    If I ever do make the site like that, I'll feel like a demiurge of my online life(<i>I think i'm using that word right</i>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm procrastinating yet again, and I don't have a good reason for it. I should be working more on my other assignments, but i
                    just can't i'm unable to because i don't know how to start. I also don't want to be doing it and then find out i'm doing it wrong
                    and then find out that i need to do it all over again or something. This sucks. I promise i'll start working on an assignment that 
                    is due today, and also finish it today. If i have to go do something else, then i'll just have to work on something else the next day.
                    I could probably get a lot done, but i don't know how to do it without feeling so overwhelmed. If i try setting myself some limits 
                    (<i>like a schedule</i>) I'll find myself unable to follow it because of how much little time i have. 
                    I slept really late yesterday because i would've rather had fun playing than sleeping to wake up early. I mean i woke up early anyway,
                    but I really should've gone to sleep (<i>if i had the emoji where they show all their teeth like a yikes, i would have it here. just
                        imagine it</i>).
                    I'll start getting ready to go to my 2:00pm class since it's already 1:43. I'll keep writing about today soon. I'm also decided
                    I'm going to be posting the new link on here
                </p>

            <h2>Second day streak</h2>
                <h3>April 11 11:47am</h3>

                <p>
                    I'm currently working on doing something kool for this section of the site. It's just a lot of links and pointing to things. 
                    I'm going to be adding short summaries of what i did and they're going to be stored in the libarry of babel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's 12:40pm right now and I hardly made any progress on that lol. I really wish I was making this site on a server rather 
                    than on github pages. I'd very much prefer to start using PHP to do all my work for me. I don't think it would be too hard to
                    start doing that top. I have some ideas on how this stuff could work. Automating things is so much better than having to do things
                    manually. I also decided that i was not going to echo entire html pages if they didn't need to be. It's just not fair to do it. 
                    Like it's actaully annoying not being able to see color on my screen when editing on a site. I'll just gladly close and reclose php. 
                    If doing that slows down the site though, I'll just make a script that converts each line into an echo and un echos it too if i need
                    to make a change. It's so kool that i have the option to do stuff like that.

                    Yesterday i felt awful and turned in that homework finally. After that i attended class online becuase i don't trust that the professor
                    is fine from covid. I was literally falling asleep during that class, but was wide awake towards the end. After that too, we got home
                    to eat Lasagna and just stayed home until the Air Jordan movie was on. The movie was at 9. I felt awful again because i stayed up way 
                    later than yesterday. I'm not going to let it happen again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll write more later because i really need to go to the restroom
                    Wow, I really needed to go. It's going to be 1, and i think i'm more glad at the fact that i was working something rather than just 
                    being on my phone. I think tomorrow I'm going to start setting up a database of all our receipts. That should get us in track. I also
                    need to start working on the assignment that is due on the 14th. I could just ask for more time, since i really am stressed, but it's 
                    going to have to be tomorrow when i ask because i seriously cannot keep up with anyhing else. i can't believe that it's not even a lot
                    of things that I have to get done. I cannot wait to turn this site into like an actual blog thing where i can post what i want. it's 
                    going to be so kool.
                </p>
                <p>I'll maybe come back to this tonight or later on in the day....or maybe during class too. I should make all this text stuff collapsable</p>
                <p>1:12pm OHH, I'M GOING TO WRITE THE REVIEW FOR MOVIE THAT I SAW YESTERDAY</p>
