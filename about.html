                <h3>Who am I?1?!?1?!</h3>
                <p>My name is Juan, but obviously go by username online (same as website domain) pizzasloth82.
                    I started going to UTSA at the start of the pandemic (probably 2020 i think), and as of writing
                    this, i am currently a Junior (I mean i started as a Junior anyway because of STC college).
                    I'm a computer science major with an interest in going into Game Development or making software.
                    I'm also, as you might tell, am interested in making websites and also would like to do this as a job
                    (i still got a long way to go for that). 
                </p>

                <h3>Why am i doing this?</h3>
                <p>I've wanted to create my own website and having something of my own on the internet
                    for a very long time. I remember attempting to create my own static website two
                    years ago (in 2019), but gave up because I did not know how I could get my own domain, where
                    to host my website, and how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. 
                </p>
                <p>It wasn't until I took my software engineering class (Fall of 2021) where I got a better idea
                    of how to start. Although my group and I didn't make some web based application, seeing other
                    groups and their products really pushed me to start this (and also becuase my friend was in
                    one of those groups and I registered for a web technolgoies class the next semester). 
                </p>
                <p>Now I'm finally doing it and every single time I push a commit that changes the website, I feel 
                    a lot better about the future </p>
