                <h3>Who am I?1?!?1?!</h3>
                <p>My name is Juan, but obviously go by username online (same as website domain) pizzasloth82.
                    I started going to UTSA at the start of the pandemic (probably 2020 i think), and as of writing
                    this, i am currently a Junior (I mean i started as a Junior anyway because of STC college).
                    I'm a computer science major with an interest in going into Game Development or making software.
                    I'm also, as you might tell, am interested in making websites and also would like to do this as a job
                    (i still got a long way to go for that). 
                </p>

                <h3>Why am i doing this?</h3>
                <p>I've wanted to create my own website and having something of my own on the internet
                    for a very long time. I remember attempting to create my own static website two
                    years ago (in 2019), but gave up because I did not know how I could get my own domain, where
                    to host my website, and how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. 
                </p>
                <p>It wasn't until I took my software engineering class (Fall of 2021) where I got a better idea
                    of how to start. Although my group and I didn't make some web based application, seeing other
                    groups and their products really pushed me to start this (and also becuase my friend was in
                    one of those groups and I registered for a web technolgoies class the next semester). 
                </p>
                <p>Now I'm finally doing it and every single time I push a commit that changes the website, I feel 
                    a lot better about the future </p>

                <h3>UPDATE: Feburary 17th, 2022</h3>
                <p>It'll be one day until I reach my two month anniversary of having my Github pages on 
                    the Web! :D<br>
                 I'm still working on my webite <i>(obviously)</i> as well as a website for my Web-Tech class and an 
                E-commerce website for my User-Interfaces class. I'm not so worried about the Web-Tech class because it's 
                similar to what I'm doing right now, but I am a bit worried about the UI class becasue I have never actually deployed
                a dynamic site (that is what we will be learning in my web tech class though). </p>
                <p>As for my personal website, I'm thinking of making a game with PICO-8 and making it playable on my site :^)<br>
                    I'm not sure what it'll be, but it might just be something very simple like Pong. I have no knowledge of LUA 
                    anymore, so it's going to take me a while to get used to it again (not that i was ever used to it in the first place).<br>
                    I also have no knowledge of how you can even make a PICO-8 game playable on a site, so I'll have to look into that.<br><br>
                    I estimate that this will take me like a couple of months to get that working. Maybe like 4 or 5 months to be sure.<br>
                    maybe the first few of making the game and the remaining couple of getting it posted on here (with a few more time to making the game).
                </p>
                <p>Okay that's kool. Hello by the way, future me!</p>
                <p>and to anyone who reads this too....</p>

                    <h4>New addition to the site: Web-Tech portal</h4>
                    <p>This new addition to this site was made for me so i can just quickly go to the lecuture notes on my website.</p>
