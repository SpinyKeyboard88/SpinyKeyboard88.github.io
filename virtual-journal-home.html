<h1>Salutations on reaching my digital journal </h1>

</ul>

<h2>Intentions</h2>
<p>I recently came by the urge to do something on my website since it's so empty.</p>
<p>On top of having to code, style, and design the website, I must also produce the content on here (alone). </p>
<p>I'm still yet undecided on what I'll be registering on here, but I should probably make it general content that anyone can read up on</p>

<h2>Available content</h2>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>I'll be posting my reviews (terrible takes) on Movies, Games, and Music (srs who has anything to say about music???)</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Movies</h4></li>
<p>I watch movies
    I've seen some really REALLY boring movies, really funny, sad, kool, but probably not a lot of bad 
    (<i>though I've seen some movies others claim are bad</i>)</p>
<p>I guess the only real way to know for sure if anyone would consider if my takes are even worth the time for reading is if 
    you see what I think about other movies (<i>kind of like a litmus test?</i>)</p>
    </ul>

<li><h4>Games</h4></li>
    <p>I play games</p>
    <p>I tried to play many games on different systems, but ultimately, it's very difficult when you don't really have the time anymore, 
        the consoles to play them on, and the game to play. I know there is this thing called an emulator, but the experience just isn't the same</p>
    <p>I do however watch a lot of YouTube videos and read game reviews and wonder why the heck am i not doing that?</p>
    <p>Main reason why i brought myself back when i asked myself that question is becuase i'm just not good with words (<i>lol</i>)</p>
    <p>I'll be providing some takes i have on certain games to let anyone know whether or not reading on anything i say is worth reading or not</p>
</ul>

<li><h4>Music</h4></li>
    <p>I listen to music</p>
    <p>Okay, i don't really listen to a lot of music, but I obviously have at some point. I think it's worth just talking about 
        some music that you like. Sure I don't have the right amount of knowledge on what parts of a song are called what, but i really
        like how it sounds. If i eventually learn the name of how some things sound, then I'll start using the correct wording for people
        obssessed with music.</p>
    <p>I honeslty do not understand how some people listen to music and think it's so deep and has a lot of meaning. I cannot
        listen to the music and not get distracted by the insturments in the background. </p>
    <p>I kind of went on about one take on what i thought about music, but I'll explain further sometime</p>
</ul>
<h3>Daily Records</h3>
<p>DO NOT LOOK HERE</p>
<p>just kidding, i want to write something every day about waht i'm doing, or what's going on</p>
