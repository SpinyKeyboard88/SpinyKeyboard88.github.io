                <article>
                    <p>This list will be pretty short since there isn't much to make sure of what you have on hand <br>
                        A list of things that should be taken out are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MixPre10</li>
                        <li>Microphones</li>
                        <li>Do not disturb sign</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Everything needed to turn on the MixPre10 is in one bag</p>
                    <p>The microphones and cables for the microphones should be all in a clear bag</p>
                    <p>If you are recording for the podcast, make sure to have a <span class="important">release form</span> printed out for the guest to sign.
                    Otherwise, the podcast might not be allowed to be released.</p>

                <h3>MixPre10 setup</h3>
                <p>Since the microphones and cables are numbered, just be sure to connect them to the numbered ports 
                    so it's easier to troubleshoot in case something isn't going as planned.

                    <h3>Adjusting the knobs</h3>
                    <p>After powering on the MixPre10 the indicator should be red and the screen should turn on</p>
                    <p>The indicator is numbered 1</p>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>After it's powered on, microphones are connected and turned on, you can start turning the knob
                        to see if sound is getting picked up by the microphone.
                    </p>
                    <p>When moving the numbered knobs, the screen should tell you what level they are at<br>
                    the levels <span class="important">should be around 48 to 52</span>. This varies on how loud or low the speaker is</p>
                    <p>If the speaker too much of a loud voice, it can go just a bit lower than 48.
                        If a speaker speaks too low, you can set the knob to go to 52, and should remind them to be a little closer to the microphone
                        so everyone can hear them better and to ensure that the microhpone picks up on their voice. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Note: <span class="important"> It is not recommended to go over 52 since that's where i notice the microphone starts picking
                            up background noise from the room.
                        </span>

                    <h3>Arming the Mics</h3>
                    <p>A <span class="important"> very important </span> step is to make sure that the mics are ARMED</p>
                    <p>This is so a separate mono file can be recorded for each person. In case of a loud cough, 
                        too much background noise, or other issue comes from one mic, it can be isolated and fixed.
                    </p>
                    <p>To check if a microphone is armed, you can tap on the screen and see if the numbers are red</p>
                    <p>If they are in gray, then you need to ARM them</p>

                            <p>To ARM, push in the knob of the microphone not currently ARMed</p>
                            <p>A new screen should pop up, then click on ARM</p>

                    <h3>Feedback from mics</h3>
                    <p>When speaking into the mic, the numbered knobs should turn green</p>
                    <p>If they are not turning green, make sure the mic is turned on and correctly connected to the MixPre10</p>
                    <p style="color: #8BC34A;">Green means that the audio level is good</p>
                    <p style="color: #F1C232;">Yellow means that it's a bit too loud</p>
                    <p style="color: #E53935;">Red means that it is very loud</p>
                    <p>Although you can potentially fix how much sound is coming through the microhpone,
                         it's always best to ensure that feedback stays green

                    <h3>Adjusting headphone grain</h3>
                    <p>If the sound coming into your headpones is too loud and your microphone is already set around 48 to 52
                        then you can adjust the headphone grain
                    </p>
                    <p>move the knob numbered 21 on the image until the screen tells you the headphone grain level is 72
                        or wherever you think is not too loud
                    </p>
                    <p>I chose the number 72 because it seems to be not too loud and not too low, and have been using it for every podcast
                        that was recorded.
