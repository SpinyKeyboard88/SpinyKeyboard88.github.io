		Please navigate to the other pages using the links above (they're in the navbar)<br><br><br><strong>This is the second column for the main body. </strong>That map on the right is Onett. It's a map from one of my dearest SNES games. It's one of the first places you get to explore which really gets you familiar with the type of game it is. I like the detail they put in this map and the way that the map was made. It's at a diagnoal rather than vertical which shows you more of the building rather than just having it face forward and showing you only one side. It's a game about a young boy who must go out on an adventure to save the world. Sounds kinda cliche, but I guess for the time it was a nice story (also it's a game that kids were supposed to play so). Along the way, you meet some friends and battle strange enemies (or sometimes just people that happen to be bad). I just realized I never said what game this was from, it's <strong>EARTHBOUND</strong></td>
